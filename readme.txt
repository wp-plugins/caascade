Caascade allows users to request output from the Maxima CAS.

== Description ==

Caascade is a Computation-as-a-Service API. Using Wordpress Shortcode, this plugin allows forms to be embedded for various mathematical operations. Users can enter expressions which are evaluated by a Caascade server. The output from running an operation is captured and returned in a format chosen by the site admin. Notable features include PDF and Recaptcha support. The Caascade plugin may be useful to bloggers and other web publishers who would like their readers to interact with mathematical site content.

Tetragy welcomes requests for new operations that may be specific to a user or organization. The current version of the plugin provides for the following operations:

Arithmetic

- add
- subtract
- multipliy
- divide
- exponent
- factorial
- double factorial
- is greater than
- is greater than or equal to
- is less than
- is less than or equal to

Algebra

- expand
- factor
- evaluate
- distribute over
- absolute value
- factor out
- polynomial divide
- square root

Number Theory

== Installation ==

A Caascade ID is necessary and may be obtained from https://tetragy.com/. Accounts are necessary to allocate resources and prevent abuse of user and network services. Links to the Tetragy Limited privacy policy and terms of service may be found at the bottom of all .tetragy.com pages.

1. Download and expand the Wordpress Caascade zip file to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Whitelist your server IP addresses or disable enforcing at `math.tetragy.com/user`.
3. Visit the Caascade settings page of your Wordpress site to configure your ID.
4. Use Shortcode in your posts to include a Caascade operation. For example: `[caascade com="prime"]`.

A demonstration of select operations can be found at http://wp.tetragy.com/.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much does it cost ? =

$0.00105 per request.

= Can I try out the services ? =

Yes, 250 points are awarded with signup, and another 250 points are awarded the first of every month.

= How does the point system work ? =

Tetragy offers three distinct web services and uses a point system to create a digital currency between services. Points may be used for Caascade computation requests, statistical operations, or LaTeX document compiling.

= Do I need Maxima installed on my server ? =

No, Maxima does not need to be installed on your server. Wordpress and the Caascade plugin are the only software requirements. Configuring your Caascade account with a dedicated IP address is recommended to prevent unauthorized use of your Caascade ID.

= How do I prevent spam submissions ? =

With Recaptcha you can help prevent spam and other abuse of your Caascade account. Configure the public and private key settings to automatically add a Recaptcha form to all your widgets. This plugin also includes support for Recaptcha themes.

= Why is it recommended to whitelist my IP address ? =

To prevent unauthorized use of your Tetragy account. If IP enforcing is disabled, Caascade requests made with your ID will be deducted from your account.
